<h2>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h2>

->>*In this project we have made a bot which can be controlled by
    mobile app through HC-05 bluetooth module connected to arduino
    the brain of the bot.There is a special feature that the bot can run
    automatically with the help of ultrasonic sensor and servo motor in automatic mode.*

<h3>FUNCTION PREVIEW</h3>

   ->>*The bot is totaly controlled by mobile app .when user press the key of the app then
       it send signal to the arduino and arduino does work according to command .In automatic mode
       the arduino control the bot taking data from ultrasonic sensor moving servo motor.*
       
<h3>CIRCUIT DIAGRAM</h3>

   ->>*The circuit diagram is given below only the HC-05 is not available .The rx pin of Hc-05 will be
    connected to arduino Tx pin and Tx pin will be connected to the Rx pin of the arduino.And Vcc will be connected to
    5 v and Ground pin will be connected to Ground of the arduino.*
